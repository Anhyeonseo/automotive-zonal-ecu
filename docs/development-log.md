# Development Log

This document records engineering decisions and verified milestones rather than a
day-by-day activity diary.

## Milestone 1 — MCU baseline

### Goal

Establish a known-good board, clock and GPIO baseline before adding communication.

### Result

- NUCLEO-G474RE flash/debug through ST-LINK
- 24 MHz HSE and 170 MHz SYSCLK
- On-board and external LED output verification
- Switch input and debounce verification

### Why it matters

A known-good clock and GPIO baseline prevents peripheral configuration problems from
being confused with basic board or debugger problems.

## Milestone 2 — FDCAN controller bring-up

### Goal

Verify the MCU CAN FD controller without involving transceiver wiring.

### Result

- CAN FD with BRS configuration
- 500 kbit/s arbitration and 2 Mbit/s data phase
- Internal loopback TX/RX
- FIFO0 new-message interrupt callback
- Periodic status transmission and alive counter observation

### Gate

TX/RX counters increase, alive counters remain sequential and communication-error counters
remain zero during uninterrupted execution.

## Milestone 3 — Local inputs and distance sensor

### Goal

Turn simple peripheral experiments into reusable ECU services.

### Result

- ADC calibration and 10 ms sampling service
- Raw ADC to millivolt, percent and permille conversion
- 20 ms switch debounce and press counter
- VL53L0X initialization and measurement state machine
- Distance validity, range status, error and timeout counters

## Milestone 4 — Vehicle-style application contract

### Goal

Separate sensor acquisition, CAN transport and vehicle policy.

### Result

- `FrontZonalStatus` and `CentralControlCommand` contracts
- ECU states: `INIT`, `NORMAL`, `DEGRADED`, `SAFE`
- 500 ms command timeout and deterministic LED-off safe output
- 200/250 mm distance-warning hysteresis
- Sensor fault injection path
- Temporary Central Computer simulator for closed-loop testing

## Milestone 5 — Main reduction and module extraction

### Problem

Peripheral logic, protocol fields, timeout checks and diagnostic variables accumulated in
`main.c`, making later FreeRTOS migration difficult to reason about.

### Decision

Move reusable logic into modules with explicit input, output and status structures:

- `InputService`
- `DistanceSensorService`
- `CanProtocol`
- `CanService`
- `CentralSimulator`
- `FrontZonalApp`

`main.c` remains the composition root that connects modules to HAL and physical outputs.

### Verification

Run host unit tests first, then repeat the board regression checklist. The refactoring is
complete only when the external behavior remains unchanged.

## Milestone 6 — Interrupt timestamp race diagnosis

### Symptom

The CAN timeout count increased even though the last RX age observed in the debugger was
only a few milliseconds.

### Investigation

Independent diagnostic counters showed:

- no encode error
- no HAL TX error
- no payload error
- repeated reason 5, Front Status RX timeout
- valid and continuously changing RX timestamp

### Root cause

An RX interrupt could store a timestamp slightly newer than the `current_time` value that
the superloop had sampled earlier. Unsigned subtraction underflowed and looked like a very
large elapsed interval.

### Resolution

Add a shared elapsed-time helper that handles this interrupt ordering and normal tick
rollover, then apply it to every command/status freshness calculation.

### Evidence

Host tests and ARM build passed, and a fresh board debug session maintained normal loopback
with zero timeout/error count.

## Current baseline and next gate

Current baseline:

```text
STM32 superloop
  + modular application/services
  + host-tested pure logic
  + board-verified FDCAN internal loopback
  + ADC, switch and VL53L0X inputs
  + timeout-based safe output
```

Next gate: introduce FreeRTOS without changing CAN protocol, application policy or the
existing board regression result.
